# CODSOFT Machine learning Internship
Welcome to my repository, I started internship at CODSOFT in Machine learning.
### Starting Date: 5 Feb 2024
### End Date : 4 March 2024
## First project: Movie Genre Classification
    I started my project by understanding the data, including data types, shape, and identifying null values. Then, I visualized the genre column using a count plot. Afterward, I began cleaning the description column by removing digits, special characters, stopwords, and similar words using NLTK. Following the cleaning process, I converted the description into a numeric array using TF-IDF. Finally, I split the dataset into test and train sets and built my model using the Naive Bayes classifier algorithm. However, I achieved only 0.44% accuracy.

## Second project : SMS SPAM Dection
    I began my project by understanding the dataset, dropping unnecessary column , visualizing the distribution of spam and ham using countplot. Afterward, I cleaned the sms with the help of natural lanugae processing. Following it, I built mu model using th Navie Bayes classifer algorithm where i achieved 97% accuracy.

### Third Project: Customer Churn Dection 
    I began my next project by understanding the data, its types, shape, and categorical features. Then, I visualized the distribution of age, gender, and geography based on different country counts. Using label encoder, I converted categorical features like gender and geography into numeric values and then split the dataset. Afterward, I applied feature scaling to clean the data. Using the logistic regression algorithm, I built a model and achieved approximately 82% accuracy.
